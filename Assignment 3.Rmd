K1 <- read.table("Class_Motivation.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)

K3 <- scale(K3)

K4 <- data.frame(K3, fit$cluster)
names(K4) <- c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "cluster")
K5 <- tidyr::gather(K4, "week", "motivation", 1:5)
K6 <- K5 %>% group_by(week, cluster)
K6 <- summarise(K6, avg = mean(motivation))
K6$week <- as.numeric(K6$week)
K6$cluster <- as.factor(K6$cluster)
ggplot(K6, aes(week, avg, colour = cluster)) + geom_line() + xlab("Week") + ylab("Average Motivation")
K7 <- dplyr::count(K4, cluster)
```
What patterns do you see in the plot?
The clusters are inverse. Cluster one remains high motivation until week 3 which is when cluster two starts to rise

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
fit <- kmeans(K3, 3) 
K41 <- data.frame(K3, fit$cluster)
names(K41) <- c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "cluster")
K51 <- tidyr::gather(K41, "week", "motivation", 1:5)
K61 <- K51 %>% group_by(week, cluster)
K61 <- summarise(K61, avg = mean(motivation))
K61$week <- as.numeric(K61$week)
K61$cluster <- as.factor(K61$cluster)
 ggplot(K61, aes(week, avg, colour = cluster)) + geom_line() + xlab("Week") + ylab("Average Motivation")
```
What patterns do you see in the plot?
Cluster one starts with high motivation, but falls in week 3. Cluster 2 motivation rises and falls every other week. Cluster 3 rises in week 2, falls the following week, and then rises before it plateaus.

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```
```
```{r}
CS1 <- read.csv("HUDK4050_2017_Cluster_Survey.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
